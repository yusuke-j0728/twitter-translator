Icon Setup Instructions
=====================

This Chrome extension requires icon files. Please create the following PNG images:

1. icon16.png - 16x16 pixels
2. icon48.png - 48x48 pixels  
3. icon128.png - 128x128 pixels

Suggested icon design:
- A simple "T" letter with translation arrows
- Use Twitter's blue color (#1DA1F2) as accent
- Keep the design minimal and clear at small sizes

You can use any image editor or online tool to create these icons.
Alternatively, you can use a placeholder icon generator or download free icons.

Once created, place the PNG files in the root directory of the extension.
